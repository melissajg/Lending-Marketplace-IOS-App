## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Student Behavior Tracker
   - **Description**: Allows teachers, students and parents to stay up to date with student behavior in real time. Teachers can acknowledge positive student behavior when it happens, students can receive instant positive reinforcement and parents can be more tuned in to how their child is doing at school.
   - **Category:** Social Networking
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to purchase goods from the student store and other rewards. The camera is used to share images with parents.
   - **Story:** Creates a team between student, parent and teacher. Allows good behavior to not go unnoticed and for students to get rewards and positive reinforcement from teachers, parents and peers
   - **Market:** Any school district or individual classroom teacher of any grade could utilize this app. District wide licensing and custom features could be used for monetization. 
   - **Habit:** Teachers are using this constantly throughout the school day. Students are using the app daily to check their performance and cash in on rewards.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow teachers to access a roster of students and input behavior logs. Could actually be tested by a real teacher with a class of students. V2 would incorporate a student facing version for students to see their performance. V3 would add a way for students to earn and obtain rewards for goals met. V4 would incorporate a parent facing version.


## Final App Idea

An app that manages your borrowing and lending activities and promotes commmunity bonds by encouraging sharing within your neighborhood.
- Personal tracker that documents what a user is currently borrowing from another user (or lending out) and other related details inclduing who is borrowing it, when it was loaned out, when it is due to be return, item description, picture of item, etc. 
- History page that documents all past exchnages (loans/borrows).
- Lenders and borrowers can rate and review their experience with the item and other partipcating party to establish credibility on both ends.
- User can take a picture/video of item before/after they loan it out and borrwer can (or be required to by lender due to agreed upon lending condtions) to take a picture/video of item before and after use. All pictures and photos info will be saved in a gallery in app for future reference.
